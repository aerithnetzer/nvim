# ðŸ’¤ LazyVim

Aerith Netzer's [LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim) configuration.

Primarily to be used for Python data science development.

Some extensions on top of the original LazyVim configuration:

- MoltenNvim: MoltenNvim allows for a streamlined interaction with ipynb files. Since I do a lot of exploratory data analysis work, this is a must-have for me, especially when I want to use NeoVim in remote clusters.
- VimTex: I use VimTex for writing (and typesetting) LaTeX documents.
- Nvim-R: Nvim-R is great and allows for a seamless interaction with Rmarkdown files. Great for the occasional R work that I do.
